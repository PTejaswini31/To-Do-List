### Overview of Components
#### HTML Structure

## Input Field: 
Users can type in a new task, which serves as a placeholder for a new list item.
## Add Button: 
Clicking the **"To-DoList"** button triggers the addTask() JavaScript function to add a new task to the list.
## Task List: 
An unordered list (ul) dynamically displays each task as a list item with delete functionality.
### CSS Styling

The design is clean and minimalistic, with:
A centered layout for ease of use.
Styled input and button elements to create a modern, cohesive look.
Hover effects on buttons for a responsive feel.
A shadow effect around the app container for better visual appeal.
### JavaScript Functionality

Add Task: When the user clicks "**To-dolist**," JavaScript retrieves the task from the input field, creates a new list item, and appends it to the task list.
Delete Task: Each task has a delete button that removes it from the list when clicked.
Input Validation: The app checks for empty input, alerting the user if no task is entered to maintain list integrity.

### Potential for Expansion
To increase functionality, future updates could include:

Local Storage Integration: Save tasks to persist across sessions.
Edit Mode: Allow users to edit tasks in the list.
Task Prioritization: Add categories or priorities for better organization.
Completion Status: Add checkboxes to mark tasks as complete instead of deleting them.
### Summary
This To-Do List app is an accessible, single-file project with essential task management features. It can serve as a solid foundation for further enhancements, making it both a useful tool and a valuable learning project.
